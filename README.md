# Example Python Project

This repository contains a simple Python module located in the `src/` directory. The
module provides a greeting function and can also be executed as a script.

## Running the Code

Run the `hello.py` script directly to see the greeting:

```bash
python src/hello.py [name]
```

Replace `[name]` with your desired name. If no name is provided, the script
defaults to `World`.
